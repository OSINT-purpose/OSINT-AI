# OSINT-AI — Personal OSINT Playbook & Workspace

**Purpose:** This repository is a structured workspace to plan, conduct, and document Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) research for academic and legitimate investigative use (political science, international relations, security studies).  
It stores notes, plans, and small utilities — not sensitive data.

**Indexing token (for GitHub search / ChatGPT):** `INDEX_TEST_TOKEN__OSINT-AI__2025-08-10`

## 1) Rules of engagement (ethical & legal)

- **Only public sources.** Respect Terms of Service; no intrusion, bypassing access controls, or social engineering.  
- **Privacy first.** Avoid personal data unless clearly public and necessary for an academic purpose.  
- **Attribution & traceability.** Record URLs, timestamps, and sources’ provenance.  
- **Verification.** Cross-check facts with independent sources before drawing conclusions.

---

## 2) Core workflow (PACER)

1. **Problem framing** — define the research question (who/what/where/when/why), scope, and success criteria.  
2. **Acquisition plan** — list sources, queries, filters, and collection cadence.  
3. **Collection** — capture URLs, snapshots, hashes; log context.  
4. **Evaluation** — source reliability, bias, corroboration, temporal consistency.  
5. **Reporting** — clear notes, citations, and limits/uncertainties.

## 3) Folder convention

notes/ # working notes, leads, scratchpads
reports/ # cleaned analyses with citations
sources/ # source lists (feeds, portals, APIs)
queries/ # saved queries, operators, dorks
data/ # small CSV/JSON tables (non-sensitive)
scripts/ # lightweight utilities (safe, ToS-compliant)

## 5) Saved operators (quick start)

Put these in `queries/web-operators.md`:

- **Generic:** `"keyword A" AND "keyword B" site:.gov filetype:pdf after:2023-01-01`  
- **Domain scoping:** `site:eeas.europa.eu "sanctions" filetype:pdf`  
- **Cache/archiving:** `site:web.archive.org <URL>`  
- **Social (public):** `site:twitter.com "term" since:2024-01-01` *(respect platform ToS)*

## 6) How to use this repo with ChatGPT

Ask ChatGPT (with GitHub connected) to operate on files here:

- “Create `notes/ukraine-energy-grid.md` using the Research Note template.”  
- “Summarize all bullets in `reports/energy-imports-2024.md` into 5 claims with citations.”  
- “Draft `queries/web-operators.md` with 10 task-oriented examples for sanctions research.”  
- “Propose a PR adding `sources/eu-sanctions-portals.md` with links and update cadence.”

---

## 7) Quick test to confirm indexing

After committing this file, search on GitHub for:
repo:OSINT-purpose/OSINT-AI INDEX_TEST_TOKEN__OSINT-AI__2025-08-10
If it appears, the repo is indexed and ChatGPT can access it.

## 9) TODO

- [ ] Create `notes/first-checklist.md` from template.  
- [ ] Add `queries/web-operators.md`.  
- [ ] Add `sources/core-portals.md` (EU, UN, OECD, national gazettes).  
- [ ] Verify indexing via the token above.
